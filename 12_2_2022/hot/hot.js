/*
  Your goal is to convert a sentence into pig latin.
  You must create functions: 1. pigLatinTranslator 2. translate
  To convert a sentence into pig latin you must follow these rules:
  1. If a word starts with a consonant and a vowel,
    put the first letter of the word at the end of the word
    and add "ay." ...
  2. If a word starts with two consonants
    move the two consonants to the end of the word
    and add "ay." ...
  3. If a word starts with a vowel add the word "way"
    at the end of the word

  The expectation of the translate function is to:
  - convert any word and translate it into pig latin
  (The rules!)

  Do not forget to capitalize the first word of a sentence!
  Do not forget to check if the parameter is a string!

  With that said: It be VERY WISE TO USE THE 
  TRANSLATE FUNCTION IN YOUR PIG LATIN TRANSLATOR

  Example: 
  - PigLatinTranslator: Input: 'What are you doing later' Output: 'Atwhay areway ouyay oingday aterlay'
  - translate: input: 'answer' output: 'answerway'
