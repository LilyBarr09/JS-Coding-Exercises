**Directions**

1. Have Node installed on your computer.
2. When you open to the folder of the day, please run **npm install**

3. **I DESIGNED THIS SO THAT YOU SHOULD BE ATTEMPTING TO USE ARROW METHODS, IMPLICIT RETURNS, AND CHAINING THEM TOGETHER**

- No, it is not going to evaluate whether you are using an arrow function, implicit returns, or if you are chaining them.
- Yes, you can use regular functions and break it down into smaller steps.
- This is great for arrow functions, implicit returns, and chaining, but also great practice with **Array Methods** in general.
- The expectation is to use the two players season stats as a reference to how to create your functions.

4. Please read the **commented out directions** to know what you are supposed to create.
   1. For example: You need to create specific named functions.
5. To **RUN** your code: You must type in terminal (as long as your in the correct folder -> 12_7_2022): node index

6. To **TEST** your code: You must type in terminal:
   1. All Tests: **npm test**
   2. Tests run after every save: **npm run test:watch**
